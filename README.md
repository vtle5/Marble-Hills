# Marble-Hills
This is one of the projects I have held a leading role in. While most of the code is written by me, some of it is written by my team members. I've also made my code more basic so that it is easier to understand as the rest of my team is not as acquainted with C# as I was. Overall I've learned many lessons from this project.
